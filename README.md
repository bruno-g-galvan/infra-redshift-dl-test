# Serverless Data Lake Infrastructure 1.0
# This diagram represents an IoT Data Lake solution architecture with a serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, using various AWS services. Here's a detailed summary of each component:

### Edge
1. **IoT Devices**: Multiple IoT devices (Device01, Device02, Device03) are connected to the cloud. These devices are certified and communicate data to the AWS Cloud.

### Data Sources
1. **Kaggle**: A data exchange platform, possibly for importing datasets.
2. **CSV**: Data from SUSAUD, possibly healthcare data in CSV format.

### AWS Cloud
1. **IoT Core**: Manages the communication between IoT devices and AWS Cloud.
    - **Device Gateway**: Routes messages from devices to appropriate services.
    - **IoT Topic**: Publishes messages from IoT devices.
    - **IoT Rules**: Defines actions based on the messages received.
2. **Kinesis Data Firehose**: Streams data from IoT Core for real-time and batch processing.
3. **Lambda Functions**: Processes data in real-time.
4. **DynamoDB**: Stores processed data.
5. **Timestream**: Time-series database for storing IoT data.
6. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Sends notifications.
7. **Grafana**: Used for monitoring and visualization.
8. **CloudFormation, CloudWatch, IAM**: Used for infrastructure management, monitoring, and access control respectively.

### Data Lake
1. **RAW**: Initial unprocessed data.
    - **S3**: Storage service for raw data.
    - **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Manages data ingestion queue.
    - **Lambda**: Processes data.
    - **Glue**: Manages data catalog and ETL operations.
2. **STAGE**: Intermediate processed data.
    - **S3**: Storage service for staged data.
    - **Glue**: ETL operations.
3. **ANALYTICS**: Processed and ready-for-analysis data.
    - **S3**: Storage service for analytics data.
    - **Glue**: ETL operations.
4. **DISCOVERY**: Data exploration phase.
    - **S3**: Storage service for discovery data.
    - **Glue**: ETL operations.

### Monitoring
1. **Airflow**: Manages workflows.
2. **DynamoDB**: Stores monitoring data.
3. **Lambda**: Processes monitoring data.
4. **SNS**: Sends notifications for monitoring.

### Consumption
1. **Interactive Queries (Athena)**: Used for querying data in S3 using SQL.
    - **BI Tools**: Power BI, Tableau, QuickSight for data visualization and business intelligence.
    - **Data Scientists**: Use SageMaker for predictive modeling.
2. **Data Warehouse (RedShift)**: Stores data for long-term analysis.
3. **Predictive Models**:
    - **SageMaker**: Used for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.
    - **Notebooks, Train, Models**: Steps involved in the machine learning pipeline.

This architecture showcases a comprehensive IoT data management solution, from data ingestion and processing to analysis and visualization, leveraging various AWS services for a serverless and scalable ETL process.
